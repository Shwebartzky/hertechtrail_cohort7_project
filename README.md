## Experience
This is honestly one of the toughest thing ever but it was such a beautiful experience, i got to practise and see what bulding a website woud look like, from sitting for hours just to read code, whether its the CSS  file, html file of even bootstrap file just to understand what works and how to works or what is even csusing my code not to work perfectly. But it was easier becuase of the best coach in the world, coach maggy for always helping out and the availability of the internet.
## What i learned.
This project honestly taught me patience, taking my time to analyze,read and understand what a code is trying to do before trying to chnage or creat something new. My understanding of CSS,BOOTSTRAP AND JAVASCRIPT greatly improved as i got to see them in action
